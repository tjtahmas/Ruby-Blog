## About Me

A simple blog application created with Ruby on Rails. I simply followed the guide at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html to create this application. This was an exercise to get started learning Ruby on Rails by creating a standard CRUD blog application. 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
